# Worksheet Two

## Further `JavaScript`

We continue working through the sections/exercises on the <https://www.learn-js.org>:

1. [Object Oriented JavaScript](https://www.learn-js.org/en/Object_Oriented_JavaScript)
2. [Function Context](https://www.learn-js.org/en/Function_Context)
3. [Inheritance](https://www.learn-js.org/en/Inheritance)

The advantage of using `Learn-js.org` is that you do not have to install any software. 
You should copy you answers into files on your repository and then `push` them to `GitHub` â€” in that way we can monitor the progress you are making.
